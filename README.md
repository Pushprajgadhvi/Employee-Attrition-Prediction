# Employee Attrition Prediction  

## üìå Project Overview  
Employee attrition (or turnover) is a major concern for organizations, as retaining skilled employees saves cost and improves productivity.  
This project aims to **predict whether an employee will leave the company or not** using **Machine Learning techniques** based on HR and employee-related data.  

The goal is to provide insights that help HR teams in decision-making by identifying key factors that influence attrition.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze employee-related data and identify factors contributing to attrition.  
- Build predictive machine learning models to classify employees as **likely to stay** or **likely to leave**.  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- Provide data visualizations for better insights.
